# NRL_Elo_Model
A dynamic and iterative Elo Model from the 2017-2021 NRL season including match and ladder predictions of the 2022 season, with emphasis on the Melbourne Storm.

This project applies an Elo rating system to National Rugby League (NRL) match data from 2017–2021 to model team performance and simulate the 2022 season.

## Features
- Calculates dynamic Elo ratings for each team continiously from 2017-2021
- Incorporates home-field advantage
- Simulates match outcomes and final ladder
- Evaluates model accuracy (prediction success rate, Spearman's rank correlation, Mean Rank Error (MRE))
- Includes visualisations of team ratings over time

## Why it Matters
This model supports coaching and analytics by tracking team strength, forecasting outcomes, and identifying key trends — useful for strategic planning at clubs like the Melbourne Storm.
